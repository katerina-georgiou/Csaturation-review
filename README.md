This review explores the existence and utility of the concept of soil carbon saturation. We summarize our conceptual understanding across spatial scales, define key terminology, address common misconceptions, and review approaches used to quantify carbon saturation. Critically, we explore the utility of soil carbon saturation for informing carbon accrual, vulnerability to loss, and representations in process-based soil biogeochemical models. Here we provide the data and R script to reproduce the figures.Â

## Data

All global datasets are freely available as cited in the manuscript, and the compiled version is provided here. For this review article, we specifically focused on measurements of bulk and mineral-associated soil organic carbon (reported in units of gC/kg soil) and soil clay and silt content (reported as a %).

## Code

The provided script was run with R version 4.3.2.
